# 👋 Hello, I'm Artur Davidenko

**Software Engineer & Developer** with a strong foundation in full-stack .NET development. I'm passionate about building efficient, scalable backend systems and creating clean, user-friendly interfaces. A quick learner and team player, I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to tackle new challenges and technologies.

Recently, I completed a valuable internship at **SEB bank**, one of the largest Baltic financial institutions, where I gained hands-on experience in developing enterprise-level solutions.
